    # Dispatcher is the seam between "a named tool with arguments" and "text
    # sent to / read from a session". It is transport-agnostic: both the MCP
    # facade and the raw JSON-line protocol call #call and get back a plain
    # String (or a ProtocolError is raised, carrying a structured code).
    #
    # This is exactly the work Boukensha::Tools::Mud's `send_cmd` lambda used to
    # do — drain → send → read — lifted out of the framework so every language
    # track inherits it for free. Ruby included: that module has since been
    # deleted, and boukensha drives this daemon over MCP like everyone else.

      # originated in a spanned tool call joins the two logs exactly instead of
      # by timestamp adjacency. nil for a caller that sends none (an older

      # calls `poll`, `look`, and `check(kind: "exits")` itself. Keeping
      # composition out of the daemon means every consumer sees the same flat
      # primitive surface and no policy about "what a survey is" lives here.
