  # Deliberately NOT ActiveRecord. `room_exits` and `entity_sightings` have
  # composite primary keys and no `id`; the file has no `schema_migrations`
  # table (memory/schema.rb migrates on `PRAGMA user_version` precisely to avoid
  # one); and every connection listed in database.yml gets walked by `db:prepare`
  # / `db:test:prepare`, which must never happen to the agent's file. So this is
  # a PORO that speaks SQL, exactly like SessionLog/TelnetLog/ManagerLog are
  # POROs that speak jsonl. Rails owns storage/development.sqlite3 and nothing
  # else.
  #
  # Unlike those three, this is not a log: there is no cursor, no `seq`, and
  # nothing to tail. It is a snapshot of belief that changes underneath the
  # reader, which is why the controller polls rather than streams.

    # NAMED select of a column that does not exist raises, and named columns are
    # the whole drift-detection mechanism, so they cannot simply be dropped. So
