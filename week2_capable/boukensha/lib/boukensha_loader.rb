# BoukenshaLoader resolves which step folder and config directory to use, then
# boots the REPL.
#
# Each setting is resolved independently in this order:
#   1. BOUKENSHA_PATH / BOUKENSHA_DIR environment variable
#   2. boukensha_path / boukensha_dir in ~/.boukensharc
#   3. The bundled lib / ~/.boukensha default
#
# ~/.boukensharc is YAML:
#   boukensha_path: ~/Sites/boukensha/09_global_executable
#   boukensha_dir: ~/projects/mybot/.boukensha
# A bare single-line path (the pre-step-9 format) is still accepted and is
# treated as boukensha_path.
#
# --no-tui falls back to the plain terminal REPL (no charm-ruby).
#
# Examples:
#   boukensha                                                              # uses bundled lib + ~/.boukensha
#   BOUKENSHA_PATH=~/Sites/boukensha/04_api_client boukensha              # loads step 4
#   BOUKENSHA_DIR=~/projects/mybot/.boukensha boukensha                   # custom config dir
#   boukensha --no-tui                                                     # plain REPL, no TUI

  # The MUD wiring, as a proc both the REPL and a headless test case can be
  # built with. It was inline in `load_and_start_repl` and therefore reachable
  # only from the REPL, which meant `Boukensha.run` produced an agent with no
  # hooks, no memory and no navigation tools — an agent a test session could
  # not honestly be compared against. Extracted verbatim: the harness reaches
  # into production code by SHARING this setup rather than reimplementing it,
  # which is the only version where a test session is genuinely the same agent
  # as a real one.
  #
  def self.mud_agent_setup
    # Every tool the player has comes from settings.yaml's `mcp_servers:` block.
    # It used to have one native tool as well — `inspect_room`, which it called
    # to get the current room back as JSON — and it does not any more.
    #
    # The reason is in the session logs. 11 surveys covered 8 distinct rooms:
    # 27% of them re-derived a room the agent had already been told about, at
    # ~5 MUD round trips each, because nothing let it know it had been there.
    # And every result was a tool_result, so it sat in the transcript forever
    # and was re-sent on every following API call.
    #
    # So room state stops being something the model asks for and becomes
    # something it is given: `Mud::Hooks` reconciles position against SQLite
    # before each model call and renders one small, always-current state block.
    # A revisit now costs zero round trips and zero accumulated tokens. The
    # `look`/`exits`/`consider`/`examine` sequence still exists — it is
    # `Mud::RoomSurvey`, it still runs under its own allowlist, and it runs only
    # for a room the agent has genuinely never stood in.
    #
    # This glue is deployment-specific, which is why it lives at the entrypoint
    # and not in the framework core: boukensha is an MCP host that ships no
    # tools and knows nothing about MUDs. `Hooks` is the seam that keeps that
    # true.
    #
    # Note the MUD_* env override was dropped upstream. A spawned server
    # inherits this process's environment, so exporting MUD_HOST still reaches
    # the daemon, but only for keys its `env:` block doesn't set: config now
    # wins over the environment, where it used to lose.
