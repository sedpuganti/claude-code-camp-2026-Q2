module Boukensha
  # An append-only change log — the time-series sibling of the snapshot that
  # lives in knowledge.sqlite3. Where the store answers "what is true now"
  # (polled), the journal answers "what happened, in what order" (streamed),
  # and it does so in this project's native idiom for that: a daily-rotated
  # jsonl file in `.boukensha/`, exactly like `telnet/`, `manager/` and
  # `sessions/`, read by a Parser/Follower/Store trio over SSE with a `seq`
  # cursor (see change_capture.md).
  #
  # The heart is `upsert`: callers hand it the CURRENT reading every time they
  # read it and never track previous state themselves; the journal is the single
  # owner of "did this change?" and appends a line ONLY on a transition. That is
  # Change Data Capture in the honest sense — emit on change, swallow the no-ops
  # — and it is what keeps the log graphable instead of drowned in hp jitter.
  #
  # `event` is the discrete-event escape hatch for things that are ops, not
  # keyed-value transitions (an item acquired, a level milestone, a death).
  #
  # This class is world-agnostic infrastructure: it knows nothing about players,
  # rooms, or MUDs. The player streams are merely its first client.
