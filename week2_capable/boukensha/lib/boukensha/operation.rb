module Boukensha
  # The unit of work, as ambient state.
  #
  # Everything else in the session log is instantaneous — a call, a result, a
  # transform. Nothing said "here is a thing that started, contained other
  # things, and finished". `buildTranscriptTree` compensated by folding *runs of
  # adjacent* hook calls together, and adjacency is a proxy for containment that
  # is wrong in both directions: one model call landing mid-survey splits a
  # single operation into two groups, and a survey's calls sit as siblings of
  # the position refresh they actually ran *inside*.
  #
  # So containment becomes a fact rather than a guess, and this is where it
  # lives. It is a bare thread-local stack rather than an argument threaded
  # through Logger, the dispatcher, RoomSurvey, Store and Journal for the reason
  # Logger's own comment already gives about `task`: a field a call site can
  # forget is a field that goes dead. The argument is stronger here, because
  # there are now TWO writers — Logger and Journal — that must agree on which
  # operation is current, and one call site forgetting to pass it means a CDC
  # line silently attributed to nothing.
  #
  # The cost, named rather than hidden: it is invisible at the call site, and it
  # is per-THREAD. A future concurrent agent gets correct isolation for free; a
  # future fiber scheduler would not, and would need Fiber storage here instead.

    # `trigger` is the lifecycle seam the OUTERMOST span fired from, inherited
    # downward: a survey opening inside `before_model` fired from `before_model`
    # too, and making RoomSurvey name a seam it should know nothing about is how
    # a label ends up disagreeing with the truth.
    #
    # `attributes` is the one field a call site fills in DURING the span rather
    # than at open time — `#set` merges into it, and Logger#operation folds the
    # bag into `operation_end` alongside the counter delta. Without it there is
    # nowhere to hang a fact only known once the block is running (the model
    # actually used, the token counts, the room resolved) — Struct's other
    # fields are all decided at `open`.
