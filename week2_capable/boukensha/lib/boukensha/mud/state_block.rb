    # This is not the room record. The record is five tables; this is four lines,
    # and the gap between them is the point — the model does not need the room's
    # first_seen_at, its fingerprints, or its prose for the fourth time.

    #   [here] Market Square  (visit 2)
    #   exits: north→The Temple Square ✓ | east→Main Street ✓ | south→The Common Square ✓ | west→Main Street ?

    #   you: 20/20hp 100mana 81mv · lvl 1 · 43 gold · standing

    # Measured against what it replaces: the old `inspect_room` payload was ~230
    # tokens and PERMANENT (a tool_result, re-sent on every later call, once per
    # visit). This is ~45 tokens, transient, and there is only ever one copy.

      # north/east/south/west/up/down. One session lost an iteration to
      # `move(direction: "d")` for exactly that reason. The state block and the
      # tool schema now speak one grammar; the few extra tokens per refresh buy
      # back a failed round trip. Loosening the schema instead was rejected —
