    # The round trips. Everything Mud::RoomParser refuses to do.
    #
    # This is the sequencing half of what used to be `Tools::InspectRoom`, and
    # it is no longer a tool: nothing the model can call reaches it. It runs
    # from `Mud::Hooks#before_model`, and only for a room the agent has never
    # stood in — which is the whole saving. A revisit costs zero of the calls
    # below.
    #
    # It still runs under its OWN allowlist (`tools.room_survey.allow` in
    # settings.yaml) — look, check(exits), consider, examine, nothing else —
    # because retiring the tool must not widen the tool surface. `look` is
    # deliberately absent from the *player's* allowlist, so this is the only
    # route to a room survey.
    #
    # `call_tool` is injected (`->(name, args) { text }`) so the whole survey is
    # testable against a transcript with no MUD, no MCP, and no network.
    #
    # Two things that used to live here are gone on purpose:
    #   * `poll` — it was step 1 of the survey, which is the one moment in the
    #     loop it cannot succeed (the preceding command's pre-send drain already
    #     ate the buffer). It moved to Hooks#before_tools. See plan §5.6.
    #   * the session-lifetime `@keywords` cache — it is the `entities` table
    #     now, so an appraisal survives process exit and is reused in a room it
    #     was never made in.

      # every mob every time, which is exactly today's behaviour.
      # `logger:` — used for ONE thing: opening the `room_survey` span that owns
      # everything below. The four commands are one unit of automatic work, and
      # a reader that sees them as four separate player actions is being lied
      # to. The span is opened HERE rather than by the hook that calls us so it

      # appraised. In Midgaard, after the first hour, that is usually every mob
      # in the room.
      # `look:` — an ALREADY-PARSED look to survey against, when the caller has
      # just spent one itself. Pass it only for the output of a real `look`,
      # never for a movement result: `run_command` drains the buffer before
