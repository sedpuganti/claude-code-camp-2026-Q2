    # PROVENANCE. A session contains two kinds of tool call that used to be

    #
    #   the model asked for it        initiator: "model"
    #   framework/hook code ran it    initiator: "hook"   on the model's behalf
    #
    # Without the split, a hook's cold-start `score`/`look` reads as the agent
    # checking its own sheet, and the ~1.9s that `score` blocks for reads as
    # model latency. `operation` says WHY (player_bootstrap, position_refresh,
    # room_survey, async_poll) and `trigger` says from WHICH lifecycle seam.
    #
    # `operation`/`trigger`/`operation_id` are NOT parameters: they are read
    # from the span this call is happening inside, for the same reason `task` is
    # not a parameter. They used to be threaded from Hooks through the
    # dispatcher's third `meta` argument — one call site per hop that could
    # forget them, which is how the survey's own calls could come out
    # unattributed. The ambient version cannot go dead.
    #
    # The `operation` STRING is written alongside the id even though the id is
    # what the tree is built from: it is human-readable, and it survives a log
    # whose spans were truncated mid-write.
    #
    # Returns the generated `call_id`. The matching `tool_result` carries the
    # same id, so a reader pairs the two exactly instead of guessing by
    # name+depth — which is ambiguous the moment two identical calls are in
