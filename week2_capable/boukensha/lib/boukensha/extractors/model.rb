    # files' own `E` blocks, exported to ONNX, and run here in ~10ms. That is
    # ~1/120th of a single MUD round trip, and it replaced three LLM calls.

    # Every inference parameter — threshold, top_k, max_len, which room fields
    # form the encoder context — comes from the artifact's manifest.json, never
    # from a constant here. Weights and thresholds are built together and drift
    # together (a retrain moves the calibration by ±5 F1 while the *ranking*
    # stays put), so a threshold is a property of one build, not of the design.
