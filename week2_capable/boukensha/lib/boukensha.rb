  # Run a subagent turn and return its text response.
  #
  # This is how one task delegates to another. It resolves `task_class`'s
  # provider / model / system prompt from settings.yaml (exactly as .run does
  # for the player), registers the tools that task is allowed to see, feeds
  # `input` as the sole user message, and runs the agent loop to completion.
  #
  # The subagent's tools come from the SAME shared MCP clients the parent uses
  # (#mcp_clients), scoped by the task's `tools:` filter — so a subagent drives
  # the player's live MUD session (no second login) but sees only its slice. It
  # runs for up to the task's own `max_iterations`.
  #
  # Because provider/model/prompt come from the task's settings block, swapping
  # a subagent to a local Ollama model later is config-only.
  #
  # Nothing ships that uses this today: the one subagent that did — the agentic
  # `room_inspector` — became scripted Ruby and then a lifecycle hook. The seam
  # stays because delegation is a framework capability, not a MUD one.
  #
  # `logger:` — pass the CALLER's logger (the player's) and the sub-run appends
  # to that session file, bracketed by task_start/task_end and with every event
  # stamped with this task's name (plan Amendment A). Omit it and the sub-run
  # mints its own file as before, which is what standalone callers and tests
  # want. A borrowed logger is never closed here: it belongs to the parent, and
  # closing it would silently truncate the rest of the parent's turn.
  # `tools:` — false registers NO tools and skips MCP entirely. A task that
  # reads text and answers text (the judge) would otherwise spawn every
  # configured server just to register zero of their tools behind a deny-all
  # allowlist — which for the `mud` server means a second telnet login, taken
  # out from under whatever else is playing.

  #
  # The room survey used to be an LLM subagent, so it reached its tools through
  # run_task; then a plain Ruby tool; and now not a tool at all. What survived
  # all three shapes is the scoping: it must NOT inherit the player's
  # permissions — `look` is off the player deliberately, and this is the only
  # route to it — so it keeps its own `allow:` block under `tools.<name>.allow`
  # and this hands it exactly that slice.
  #
  # It is also a SEPARATE Registry, which is what keeps a hook's own poll/look
  # from re-entering after_tool and recursing through the agent loop.
  #
  # Everything except the agent is what run_task already assembles: the same
  # shared MCP clients (#mcp_clients, so the survey drives the player's live
  # session with no second login), the same Registry, the same default-deny.
  #
  # `logger:` — pass the caller's logger and every call is bracketed with
  # tool_call/tool_result stamped with the tool's name, which is the shape
  # mud_monitor's session view reads. The task_start/task_end pair is the
  # caller's to open, because it brackets the whole survey rather than each
  # command.
  #
  # `initiator:` — stamped on every event this dispatcher writes, and the whole
  # point of it: a call that arrives here was NOT selected by the model, and a
  # log that cannot say so makes the hook's bootstrap `score` read as the agent
  # checking its own sheet.
  #
  # WHY the call is being made is no longer passed through here. It used to be a
  # third `meta` argument every caller had to remember to forward — Hooks
  # through RoomSurvey through this lambda — and a hop that forgot produced an
  # unattributed call that landed in the model's narrative as a player action.
