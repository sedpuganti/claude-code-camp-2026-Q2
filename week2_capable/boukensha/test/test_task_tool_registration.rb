# Coverage for docs/plans/week_2/native_tool_permissions.md: a native tool
# (registered by a run/repl block) is gated by
# `allow:` exactly like an MCP tool, and the ordering bug where
# validate_referenced! used to run BEFORE native tools existed in the registry
# is fixed — register_task_tools no longer validates itself; the caller
# (Boukensha.run/.repl/.run_task) validates only after ALL registration,
# MCP and native, is done.
class TestTaskToolRegistration < Minitest::Test

  # This is the ordering bug's regression test: before the fix,
  # `validate_referenced!` ran inside register_task_tools, before a run/repl
  # block's native tools were registered — so a rule naming a native tool
  # aborted boot with "references unknown tool" even though the rule was
  # perfectly valid.
